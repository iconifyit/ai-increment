## Installation

1. Place the ai-incrementor.jsx script in Applications > Adobe Illustrator > Presets > en_US > Scripts
2. Restart Adobe Illustrator to activate the scripts
3. The script will be available under menu File > Scripts > Ai Incrementor
4. You can access the script at _File > Scripts > Ai Incrementor_ (Read the Usage instructions below first).
## Usage

You can add an auto-incrementing "counter" anywhere in your Illustrator document as long as you follow these instructions *exactly*. The script uses a "replacement token" to indicate where the counter should go. The token is `${#}` (dollar sign + left curly bracket + pound sign + right curly bracket).

The counter will replace the token with the next number in the iteration in the order in which the items were added (based on the layer order).

For now, this is a dead-simple implementation. In a future version I will add the ability to add multiple, independent counters as well as the ability to place counters anywhere in the document and in any text.

1. Add the `${#}` token to your document in a separate text frame (text object).
2. The `${#}` token should be the *only* thing in the text frame.
3. Go to _File > Scripts > Ai Incrementor_ and watch the magic. (It is super fast).
4. You can simply do _Undo_ to revert back to the `${#}` tokens if you need to change something.
